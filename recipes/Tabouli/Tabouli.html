    <h1>Tabouli</h1>
    <img src="tabouli.jpg" alt="Taboulé do Lidl">

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Tabouli is likely the topmost famed Mediterranean/Middle Eastern salad there is. 
        Because it is now sold in most large supermarkets around the world, 
        I feel compelled to dispel one thing: the “star of the show," so to speak, 
        in a tabouli recipe is not the bulgur. The idea is to have a little bulgur with 
        the salad, not a little salad with your bulgur.</p>

<h2>What is in Tabouli Salad?</h2>
<p>The true star in a tabouli recipe is the very finely chopped parsley--lots of it! 
    Parsley holds well against the citrus in the dressing; that's why tabouli is even better the 
    next day. Some tabouli recipes like this one, call for a few fresh mint leaves and green onions, 
    while others use only parsley and red onions instead. 
    This recipe is closest to the version I grew up with, but feel free to make it your own.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>½ cup fine bulgur wheat</li>
            <li>4 firm Roma tomatoes, very finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 English cucumber (hothouse cucumber), very finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 bunches parsley, part of the stems removed, washed and well-dried, very finely chopped</li>
            <li>12-15 fresh mint leaves, stems removed, washed, well-dried, very finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 green onions, white and green parts, very finely chopped Salt
            </li>
            <li>3-4 tablespoon lime juice (lemon juice, if you prefer)</li>
            <li>3-4 tablespoon Early Harvest extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Romaine lettuce leaves to serve, optional</li></ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>            
<ol type="1"><li>Wash the bulgur wheat and soak it in water for 5-7 minute. Drain very well 
    (squeeze the bulgur wheat by hand to get rid of any excess water). Set aside.</li>
    <li>Very finely chop the vegetables, herbs and green onions as indicated above.
        Be sure to place the tomatoes in a colander to drain excess juice.
    </li>
    <li>Place the chopped vegetables, herbs and green onions in a mixing bowl or dish. Add the bulgur and season with salt. Mix gently.</li>
    <li>Now add the the lime juice and olive oil and mix again.</li>
    <li>For best results, cover the tabouli and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter.
        If you like, serve the tabouli with a side of pita and romaine lettuce leaves, which act as wraps or "boats" for the tabouli.
